### Source Code

```
For some reason, my code submission keeps getting deleted from PSC. However, I have found that quite a few people on the internet have been looking for a way to read metadata from WMA files. I have fixed that problem by supplying an Active-X Dll in which is a function when passed a file path, it will return information such as Artist, Title, Album, Duration, Bitrate, Mode, Copyright, Licensing, Etc.. I have uploaded a completed project (source code) along with a compiled version, if you wish browse the code for malice and recompile, there's nothing else to do. It also includes a flat text file with information on property types and function parameters. The link is: http://www.reepville.com/infotag.zip
